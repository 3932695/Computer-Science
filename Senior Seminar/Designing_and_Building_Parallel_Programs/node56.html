CC++
  does not provide low-level primitives for directly sending and
<A NAME=7057>&#160;</A>
receiving data between threads.  Instead, threads communicate by
operating on shared data structures.  For example, one thread may
append items to a shared list structure, from which another thread
removes items; this implements a form of channel communication.
CC++
  mechanisms can be used to implement a wide variety of such
communication structures.
<P>
In this section, we first explain how global pointers are used to
communicate data between processor objects.  Then, we explain how sync
variables and atomic functions are used to provide synchronization and
mutual exclusion.  Finally, we show how data transfer functions are
used to communicate more complex data structures.

CC++
  global pointers are used in the same way as C++
  local pointers;
<A NAME=7069>&#160;</A>
the only difference is that we use them to operate on data or to
invoke functions that may be located in other processor objects.
Hence, the following code fragment first assigns to and then reads
from the remote location referenced by the global pointer <tt> gp</tt>.
<P>
<PRE>global int *gp;
int len2;
*gp = 5;
len2 = (*gp) * 2;
</PRE>
<P>
As illustrated in Figure <A HREF="node56.html#figcclen" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node56.html#figcclen">5.1</A>, these read and write
operations result in communication.
<P>
If we invoke a member function of an object referenced by a global
<A NAME=7080>&#160;</A>
pointer, we perform what is called a remote procedure call (RPC).  An
RPC has the general form
<P>
<PRE>&lt;type&gt; *global gp;
result = gp-&gt;p(...)
</PRE>
<P>
where <tt> gp</tt> is a global pointer of an arbitrary <tt> &lt;type&gt;</tt>, <tt>
p(...)</tt> is a call to a function defined in the object referenced by
that global pointer, and <tt> result</tt> is a variable that will be set
to the value returned by <tt> p(...)</tt>.  An RPC proceeds in
three stages:
<OL><LI>
The arguments to the function <tt> p(...)</tt> are packed into a message,
communicated to the remote processor object, and unpacked.  The
calling thread suspends execution.
<P>
<LI>
A new thread is created in the remote processor object to execute the
called function.
<P>
<LI>
Upon termination of the remote function, the function return value is
transferred back to the calling thread, which resumes execution.
</OL>
<P>
Basic integer types (<tt> char</tt>, <tt> short</tt>, <tt> int</tt>, <tt> long</tt>,
and the unsigned variants of these), floats, doubles, and global
pointers can be transferred as RPC arguments or return values without
any user intervention.  Structures, regular pointers, and arrays can
be transferred with the aid of transfer functions, to be discussed
later in this section.

<P>
A producer thread can use an RPC to move data to a processor object in
which a consumer thread is executing, hence effecting communication.
<A NAME=7131>&#160;</A>
However, we also require a mechanism for synchronizing the execution
<A NAME=7132>&#160;</A>
of these two threads, so that the consumer does not read the data
<A NAME=7133>&#160;</A>
before it is communicated by the producer.  In the task/channel model
of Part I, synchronization is achieved by making a consumer requiring
data from a channel block until a producer makes data available.
CC++
  uses a different but analogous mechanism, the single
assignment or <em> sync
 </em> variable (Figure <A HREF="node56.html#figccsync" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node56.html#figccsync">5.3</A>).  A
sync variable is identified by the type modifier <tt> sync</tt>, which
indicates that the variable has the following properties:
<OL><LI>
It initially has a special value, ``undefined.''
<P>
<LI>
It can be assigned a value at most once, and once assigned is treated
as a constant (ANSI C and C++
  <tt> const</tt>).
<P>
<LI>
An attempt to read an undefined variable causes the thread that
performs the read to block until the variable is assigned a value.
<P>
</OL>
We might think of a sync variable as an empty box with its interior
coated with glue; an object cannot be removed once it has been placed
inside.
<P>
Any regular C++
  type can be declared <tt> sync</tt>, as can a
CC++
  global pointer.  Hence, we can write the following.
<P>
<PRE>sync int i;         // i is a sync integer
sync int *j;        // j is a pointer to a sync integer
int *sync k;        // k is a sync pointer to an integer
sync int *sync l;   // l is a sync pointer to a sync integer
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME=7157>&#160;</A>
We use the following code fragment to illustrate the use of <tt> sync</tt>
variables.  This code makes two concurrent RPCs to functions defined
in Program <A HREF="node56.html#progccrw" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node56.html#progccrw">5.5</A>: one to read the variable <tt> length</tt> and
one to write that variable.
<P>
<PRE>Length *global lp;
int val;
par {
   val = lp-&gt;read_len();
   lp-&gt;write_len(42);
}
</PRE>
<P>
What is the value of the variable <tt> val</tt> at the end of the parallel
block?  Because the read and write operations are not synchronized,
the value is not known.  If the read operation executes before the
write, <tt> val</tt> will have some arbitrary value.  (The <tt> Length</tt>
class does not initialize the variable <tt> length</tt>.)  If the
execution order is reversed, <tt> val</tt> will have the value 42.
<P>
This nondeterminism can be avoided by modifying
Program <A HREF="node56.html#progccrw" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node56.html#progccrw">5.5</A> to make the variable <tt> length</tt> a <tt>
sync</tt> variable.  That is, we change its definition to the following.
<tt> sync int length;</tt>
<P>
Execution order now does not matter: if <tt> read_len</tt> executes
first, it will block until the variable <tt> length</tt> is assigned a
value by <tt> write_len</tt>.

<P>
Global pointers and <tt> sync</tt> variables can be used to implement a
variety of communication mechanisms.  In this example, we use these
constructs to implement a simple shared queue class.  This class can
be used to implement channel communication between two
<A NAME=7188>&#160;</A>
concurrently executing producer and consumer tasks: we simply allocate
a queue object and provide both tasks with pointers to this object.
We shall see in Section <A HREF="node62.html#secccchan" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node62.html#secccchan">5.11</A> how this <tt> Queue</tt> class
can be encapsulated in the more convenient <tt> Channel</tt> class used in
Program <A HREF="node53.html#progccbuild" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node53.html#progccbuild">5.3</A>.
<P>
Recall that a channel is a message queue to which a sender can append
a sequence of messages and from which a receiver can remove messages.
The only synchronization constraint is that the receiver blocks when
removing a message if the queue is empty.  An obvious
CC++
  representation of a message queue is as a linked list, in which each
entry contains a message plus a pointer to the next message.
Program <A HREF="node56.html#progccch0" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node56.html#progccch0">5.6</A> takes this approach, defining a <tt> Queue</tt>
class that maintains pointers to the head and tail of a message queue
represented as a list of <tt> IntQData</tt> structures.  The data
structures manipulated by Program <A HREF="node56.html#progccch0" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node56.html#progccch0">5.6</A> are illustrated in

shown) with message values represented as <tt> sync</tt> values that are
either defined (<tt> 42</tt>) or undefined (<tt> &lt;undef&gt;</tt>).  Producer and

respectively.</em><A NAME=figccch1>&#160;</A><BR>
<P>
<P>
The <tt> Queue</tt> class provides <tt> enqueue</tt> and <tt> dequeue</tt>
functions to add items to the tail of the queue and remove items from
the head, respectively.  The <tt> sync</tt> variable contained in the <tt>
IntQData</tt> structure used to represent a linked list entry ensures
synchronization between the <tt> enqueue</tt> and <tt> dequeue</tt>
operations.  The queue is initialized to be a single list element
containing an undefined variable as its message.
<P>
The first action performed by <tt> dequeue</tt> is to read the message
value associated with the first entry in the queue.  This read
operation will block if the queue is empty, providing the necessary
synchronization.  If the queue is not empty, the <tt> dequeue</tt>
function will read the queue value, delete the list element, and
advance the <tt> head</tt> pointer to the next list element.  Similarly,
the <tt> enqueue</tt> function first allocates a new list element and
links it into the queue and then sets the <tt> msg</tt> field of the
current tail list element.  Notice that the order in which these two
operations are performed is important.  If performed in the opposite
order,
<P>

then a <tt> dequeue</tt> function call blocked on the list element <tt>
tail-&gt;value</tt> and enabled by the assignment <tt> tail-&gt;value=msg</tt> could
read the pointer <tt> tail-&gt;next</tt> before it is set to reference a
newly created element.

<P>
The <tt> sync</tt> variable allows us to synchronize the transfer of data
from a producer to a consumer.  In other situations, we may wish to
<A NAME=7249>&#160;</A>
allow two threads to operate on the same nonsync data structure while
<A NAME=7250>&#160;</A>
ensuring that they do not interfere with each other's execution.  For
example, the <tt> enqueue</tt> and <tt> dequeue</tt> operations of
Example <A HREF="node56.html#exccch1" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node56.html#exccch1">5.3</A> allow a single sender and receiver to
communicate by enqueuing to and dequeuing from a shared queue.  What
if we want multiple senders to be able to append messages to the same
queue?  We cannot allow two producers to make concurrent calls to <tt>
enqueue</tt>, as an arbitrary interleaving of two <tt> enqueue</tt> calls
could have bizarre results.  What we need is a mechanism to ensure
that only one message can be enqueued at a time.
<P>
This requirement is satisfied by CC++
 's <tt> atomic</tt> keyword.  Member
functions of an object can be declared atomic. This declaration
<A NAME=7257>&#160;</A>
specifies that the execution of such a function will not be
interleaved with the execution of any other atomic function of the
same object.  For example, to allow multiple producers to append to
the same queue, we would declare the <tt> enqueue</tt> function to be <tt>
atomic</tt>, as follows.
<P>
<PRE>atomic void Queue::enqueue(int msg) {
   tail-&gt;next  = new IntQData;
   tail-&gt;value = msg;
   tail        = tail-&gt;next;
}
</PRE>
<P>
This ensures that even if multiple producers attempt to append to the
same queue concurrently, the actual <tt> enqueue</tt> operations will
occur in some sequential order and a valid queue will be generated.

an RPC call takes an argument of that type or returns a value of that
