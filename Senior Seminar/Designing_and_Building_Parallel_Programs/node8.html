<P>
The rapid penetration of computers into commerce, science, and
education owed much to the early standardization on a single machine
<A NAME=357>&#160;</A>
model, the von Neumann computer.  A von Neumann computer comprises
a central processing unit (CPU) connected to a storage unit 
(memory) (Figure <A HREF="node8.html#figvon" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node8.html#figvon">1.4</A>).  The CPU executes a stored program
that specifies a sequence of read and write operations on the memory.
This simple model has proved remarkably robust.  Its persistence over
more than forty years has allowed the study of such
important topics as algorithms and programming languages to proceed to
a large extent independently of developments in computer architecture.
Consequently, programmers can be trained in the abstract art of
``programming'' rather than the craft of ``programming machine X''
and can design algorithms for an abstract von Neumann machine,
confident that these algorithms will execute on most target computers
with reasonable efficiency.

Our study of parallel programming will be most rewarding if we can
identify a parallel machine model that is as general and useful as the
von Neumann sequential machine model.  This machine model
must be both simple and realistic: <i> simple</i> to facilitate
understanding and programming, and <i> realistic</i> to ensure that
programs developed for the model execute with reasonable efficiency on
real computers.

<H2><A NAME=SECTION02221000000000000000>1.2.1 The Multicomputer</A></H2>
<P>
A parallel machine model called the <em> multicomputer
 </em> fits these
<A NAME=368>&#160;</A>
requirements.  As illustrated in Figure <A HREF="node8.html#figmulticomputer" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node8.html#figmulticomputer">1.5</A>, a
<A NAME=370>&#160;</A>
multicomputer comprises a number of von Neumann computers, or <em>
nodes</em>, linked by an <em> interconnection network</em>.  Each computer
<A NAME=373>&#160;</A>
executes its own program.  This program may access local memory and
may send and receive messages over the network.  Messages are used to
communicate with other computers or, equivalently, to read and write
remote memories.  In the idealized network, the cost of sending a
message between two nodes is independent of both node location and
other network traffic, but does depend on message length.

Each node consists of a von Neumann machine: a CPU and memory.

<P>
<P>
A defining attribute of the multicomputer model is that accesses to
local (same-node) memory are less expensive than accesses to
remote (different-node) memory.  That is, read and write are less
costly than send and receive.  Hence, it is desirable that accesses to
local data be more frequent than accesses to remote data.  This
property, called <em> locality</em>, is a third fundamental requirement
<A NAME=379>&#160;</A>
for parallel software, in addition to concurrency and scalability.
<A NAME=380>&#160;</A>
The importance of locality depends on the ratio of remote to local
access costs.  This ratio can vary from 10:1 to 1000:1 or greater,
depending on the relative performance of the local computer, the
network, and the mechanisms used to move data to and from the network.

to bottom: a distributed-memory MIMD computer with a mesh

<A NAME=388>&#160;</A>
We review important parallel computer architectures (several are
illustrated in Figure <A HREF="node8.html#figcomputers" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node8.html#figcomputers">1.6</A>) and discuss briefly how
these differ from the idealized multicomputer model.
<P>
The multicomputer is most similar to what is often called the <em>
distributed-memory MIMD
 </em> (multiple instruction multiple data)
computer.  MIMD means that each processor can execute a
<A NAME=391>&#160;</A>
separate stream of instructions on its own local data;
distributed memory means that memory is distributed among the
processors, rather than placed in a central location.  The principal
difference between a multicomputer and the distributed-memory MIMD
computer is that in the latter, the cost of sending a message between
two nodes may not be independent of node location and other network
<A NAME=392>&#160;</A>
traffic.  These issues are discussed in Chapter <A HREF="node26.html#chapperf" tppabs="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/text/node26.html#chapperf">3</A>.
<A NAME=394>&#160;</A>
Examples of this class of machine include the IBM SP, Intel Paragon,
<A NAME=395>&#160;</A>
Thinking Machines CM5, Cray T3D,
<A NAME=396>&#160;</A>
Meiko CS-2, and
<A NAME=397>&#160;</A>
nCUBE.
<P>
Another important class of parallel computer is the <em>
multiprocessor</em>, or shared-memory MIMD computer.  In multiprocessors,
<A NAME=399>&#160;</A>
all processors share access to a common memory, typically via a bus or
a hierarchy of buses.  In the idealized Parallel Random Access Machine
(PRAM) model, often used in theoretical studies of parallel
algorithms, any processor can access any memory element in the same
amount of time.  In practice, scaling this architecture usually
introduces some form of memory hierarchy; in particular, the frequency
with which the shared memory is accessed may be reduced by storing
<A NAME=400>&#160;</A>
copies of frequently used data items in a <em> cache
 </em> associated
<A NAME=402>&#160;</A>
with each processor.  Access to this cache is much faster than access
<A NAME=403>&#160;</A>
to the shared memory; hence, locality is usually important, and the
differences between multicomputers and multiprocessors are really just
questions of degree.  Programs developed for multicomputers can also
execute efficiently on multiprocessors, because shared memory permits an
efficient implementation of message passing.  Examples of this class
<A NAME=404>&#160;</A>
of machine include the Silicon Graphics Challenge,
<A NAME=405>&#160;</A>
Sequent Symmetry,
<A NAME=406>&#160;</A>
and the many multiprocessor workstations.
<P>
A more specialized class of parallel computer is the <em> SIMD
 </em>
<A NAME=408>&#160;</A>
(single instruction multiple data) computer.  In SIMD machines, all
processors execute the same instruction stream on a different piece of
data.  This approach can reduce both hardware and software complexity
but is appropriate only for specialized problems characterized by a
high degree of regularity, for example, image processing and certain
numerical simulations.  Multicomputer algorithms <em> cannot
 </em> in
general be executed efficiently on SIMD computers.  The MasPar MP is
<A NAME=410>&#160;</A>
an example of this class
<A NAME=411>&#160;</A>
of machine.
<P>
Two classes of computer system that are sometimes used as parallel
<A NAME=412>&#160;</A>
computers are the local area network (LAN), in which computers in
<A NAME=413>&#160;</A>
close physical proximity (e.g., the same building) are connected by a
<A NAME=414>&#160;</A>
fast network, and the wide area network (WAN), in which geographically
<A NAME=415>&#160;</A>
distributed computers are connected.  Although systems of this sort
introduce additional concerns such as reliability and security, they
<A NAME=416>&#160;</A>
can be viewed for many purposes as multicomputers, albeit with high
<A NAME=417>&#160;</A>
remote-access costs.  Ethernet and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
<A NAME=418>&#160;</A>
are commonly used network technologies.
